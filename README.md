# Grand_Line_Battleship(OP) 
_**Help the Strawhats escape the marines!**
_
## The Game
**standard battleship game rules with a few tweaks**
  - the main premace is the _player grid_. Each square is for the player(s) representing the battlefeild, at sea.
  - player has the freedom to pick which ever square they want
  - a single grid is a single slot.
  - a ship may take up to 3 slots total.
  - the oponent uses the same gird for their turn.
  - works as single player as well.
  - a header will be displayed at the top, showing the score and whose turn it is
  - reset button

## What I would like to accomplish 
- i want to try out a "drag and drop" function, (dragDrop). This would make the game more interactive, by allowing the player to move and rotate the ships. In addition, id like to have the option of sinle player/ multiplayer.
- curated styling to compliment the One Piece theme

## Expected Challenges Ahead
  The HTML and CSS should be quite simple. Each ship will be given its own div class and then the spaces it contains would be div id. Ill be using CSS for my dimensions and interactive things like color. The challenges i excpect are in JS. for example, the use of the empty slots on the grid. The use of parameters and setting listener for the many functions.
